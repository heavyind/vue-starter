# Vue SSR Starter

## What it is

A Vue SSR web application that uses Vue Router, Vuex, [@heavyind/vue-trans](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@heavyind/vue-trans), [@heavyind/vue-modal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@heavyind/vue-modal), and [@heavyind/vue-bi18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@heavyind/vue-bi18n).

## Who it's for

Those developing design-heavy Vue applications. It's tailored specifically for Heavy Industries needs and not general consumption, but you're more than free to poke around the code for ideas. It's MIT-licensed, so hack away.

## To use:

```
$ npm run watch
$ node server.js <port number> `# defaults to 8080`
```

## License
