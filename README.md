# Vue SSR Starter

## What it is

A Vue SSR web application that uses Vue Router, Vuex, @heavyind/vue-trans, @heavyind/vue-bi18n, and @heavyind/vue-modal.

## Who it's for

Those developing design-heavy Vue applications. It's tailored specifically for Heavy Industries needs and not general consumption, but you're more than free to poke around the code for ideas. It's MIT-licensed, so hack away.

## To use:

```
$ npm run watch
$ node server.js <port number> `# defaults to 8080`
```

## License

MIT
